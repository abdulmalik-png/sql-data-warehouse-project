#SQL-Server-Ingestion-Pipeline
----
Welcome to the Project Repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete SQL Server–based Data Warehouse Pipeline using a structured multi-layer architecture. The solution covers data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, modeling, and analytics, following real-world Data Engineering standards.

####☑️ This project is designed to show end-to-end skills in:

Data ingestion automation.
Data quality management.
Dimensional modeling.
Optimized SQL transformations.
Analytical reporting using SQL.
##🏗️ Data Architecture
The project uses a three-layer warehouse architecture: Architecture

Landing Layer (Raw Zone):
Stores raw incoming data exactly as received.
No transformations applied.
Helps in traceability and replay if reprocessing is required.
Refined Layer (Clean Zone):
Data is cleaned, standardized, validated, deduplicated, and type-corrected.
Business rules are applied.
Data becomes ready for modeling.
Analytics Store (Final Zone):
Star-schema tables (Fact & Dimension tables).
Optimized for reporting and BI tools.
Supports analytical queries like trends, aggregations, and KPIs.
##📖 Project Overview
This project builds a complete Data Warehouse Pipeline in SQL Server with the following major components:

####🔹 Data Ingestion:

Upload data from CSV sources into Landing tables.
Use controlled schemas and metadata for consistent ingestion.
####🔹 Data Transformation:

Clean null values and inconsistent data.
Apply business rules such as mapping, standardization, and conversions.
Integrate data from multiple sources.
####🔹 Data Modeling:

Create Dimension tables (DimCustomer, DimProduct, DimDate…).
Create Fact tables (FactSales, FactOrders…).
Apply surrogate keys, relationships, indexing, and constraints.
####🔹 Data Analysis:

Build analytical SQL queries answering business questions such as:
Customer behavior.
Product performance.
Sales KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).
Time-series trends.
Aggregated reporting
####🔹 Documentation:

Clear folder structure.
SQL scripts for every step.
Easily reusable for interviews or portfolio use.
##🚀 Project Requirements
Objective:
Develop a clean, scalable SQL Server–based data warehouse that consolidates raw source data into a structured analytical model. The goal is to support insights such as customer behavior, sales performance, and business KPIs through optimized SQL reporting.

Specifications:
Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
##📊 BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)
Objective:
Build SQL-driven analytical reports that provide deep insights into business performance. The goal is to transform cleaned and modeled data into meaningful metrics that support strategic decision-making.

Focus Areas:
Customer Behavior.
Product Performance.
Sales Trends.
These analytical insights help stakeholders monitor KPIs, identify growth opportunities, evaluate operational performance, and make informed business decisions based on data.
